# Store multiple values in one place

You can declare array as usual by typing square brackets

``` js
let arr = []
const users = ["user1", "user2"]
```

Array doesn't require you to have elements of the same type
``` js
let randomThingsInCache = ["imageUrl", "p!ssw0rd", 1293, null, "eee"]
```

## Array length

``` js
const names = ["Kyle", "Justin", "Ferry"]
// names.length: 3

names[names.length - 1]
// output: "Ferry"
```
