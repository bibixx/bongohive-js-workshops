# We all love those equations

We can divide operators into 3 main groups
1. Assignment - make `x` equal to 14
2. Comparison - is `x` greater than `y`
3. Logical - does `x` **and** `y` are both greater than 10

## Assignment

``` js
const dog = 'Mambo'

let age = 12
// after one year
age++
// age: 13

let points = 5
points += 10
// points: 15
```
